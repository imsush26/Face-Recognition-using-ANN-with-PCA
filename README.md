# Face-Recognition-using-ANN-with-PCA

# Project Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). It utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction, and an MLPClassifier (Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network) for classification. The dataset used is the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.

# Features
1) Face Data Preprocessing: Uses OpenCV and NumPy for image processing.
2) Feature Extraction: Applies PCA to extract key facial features.
3) Dimensionality Reduction: Uses LDA to optimize the feature space.
4) Neural Network Classification: Implements an MLPClassifier for face recognition.
5) Performance Evaluation: Achieves an accuracy of 88.07%.
6) Visualization: Displays eigenfaces and prediction results using Matplotlib.
